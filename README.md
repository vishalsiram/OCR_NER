# OCR_NER

### Installation of Tesseract OCR:
Download the latest installer for windows 10 from “https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki“. Execute the .exe file once it is downloaded.

Note: Don’t forget to copy the file software installation path. We will require it later as we need to add the path of the tesseract executable in the code if the directory of installation is different from the default.

The typical installation path in Windows systems is C:Program Files.

So, in my case, it is “C: Program FilesTesseract-OCRtesseract.exe“.

Next, to install the Python wrapper for Tesseract, open the command prompt and execute the command “pip install pytesseract“.
